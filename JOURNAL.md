# DIY voice assistant

Total time spent: 2hr

I have set out to build a diy voice assistant with a 3d printed case and a high quality speaker (for its size).

## Friday 16th May: Choosing a speaker driver

Today I have researched different speaker drivers to choose one suitable for my project. Due to space constraints I will be using a 4" or smaller driver from a reputable brand. Below I have listed some of the best options I have found below (with the LSX as being a fun "challenge" project driver).

#### Dayton Audio PS95 

- 3.5" driver size
- 20w RMS
- 8Ω impedence
- 100Hz - 20kHz frequency response (good but lacks some of the lowest bass)
- Looks cool as hell
- Expensive at ~£40
- Circular mounting

#### Faital Pro 3FE25

- 3" driver size
- 20w RMS
- 16Ω impedence
- 100Hz - 20kHz frequency response (good but again lacks some of the lowest bass)
- Looks nice
- 4X mounting holes
- Cheap at £12
- https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/133955301828

#### KEF LSX driver

- 4" driver size
- Unknown RMS
- 8Ω Impedence
- 54Hz - 28kHz (very good for its size)
- Needs crossover
- Expensive at ~£100
- Difficult to make it work well.
- Seperate tweeter and mid driver

#### Tang Band W3-315E

- 3" driver size
- 20w RMS
- 8Ω Impedence
- 100Hz - 20kHz frequency response (good but again lacks some of the lowest bass)
- High sensitivity (90db)
- Looks nice 
- Circular mounting
- Good price at ~£26
- https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/267127968217

I have chosen the Dayton driver from this list as the driver I will be using. It has an acceptable frequency response, good wattage, good impedence, easy mounting and comes second to the LSX driver on "cool factor".
